**WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  
This plugin is experimental and may not function as intended. It could potentially disrupt your site or scripts. Always test in a staging environment before deploying to production.

## Description

The WordPress Malware Scanner Plugin scans your WordPress installation for common malware. It leverages the WordPress Filesystem API and provides three modes:
- **Dry Run:** Reports potentially infected files without making changes.
- **Clean Scan:** Creates unique backups and attempts to remove malicious code from infected files.
- **Quarantine Scan:** Moves infected files to a designated quarantine folder for further review.

Additionally, the plugin supports dynamic malware signature updates via a filter and logs detailed actions and errors for auditing and troubleshooting.

## Features

- **Multi-Mode Scanning:**  
  Choose between Dry Run, Clean Scan, and Quarantine Scan for flexible remediation options.
  
- **Advanced File Handling:**  
  Utilizes the WordPress Filesystem API to ensure secure and compatible file operations.

- **Backup and Quarantine:**  
  Automatically creates uniquely named backups before cleaning and offers an option to quarantine infected files.

- **Dynamic Signatures:**  
  Update or extend malware signatures using the `wms_malware_signatures` filter.

- **Detailed Logging:**  
  Logs all actions and errors to `wp-content/malware_scanner_log.txt` for auditing purposes.
